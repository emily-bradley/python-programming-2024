# Assignment 0:  Welcome to Intro to Machine Learning!

This assignment is a quick walk-through to help you get set up logistically for the course.  It isn't a real assignment (no problems to solve) and counts towards a small percentage of your grade (because you can't do the other assignments without it!).

**READ ALL OF THESE STEPS BEFORE RUNNING ANYTHING!**

Now we'll get you all set up with the software packages and the course GitHub.

1. Set up a github account. All assignemnts for this course will be distributed thorugh GitHub Classroom. You will receive emails in your email account associated with GitHub. You must accept the assignments to start on them.

2. **Set up your computing environment:** We are going to use Google Colab for this class.  It provides free access to a GPU which we will need in later assignments.  In your Google Drive, create a folder for this class.  You will be saving the Colab notebooks you run in this folder.

3. **Clone the course repo** On your laptop or local machine run this command in a terminal:
`git clone https://github.com/emily-bradley/intro-to-machine-learning-2024.git`
You will use this local copy to get updates as we post them and to store your work.  This [course git repo](https://github.com/emily-bradley/intro-to-machine-learning-2024/tree/main) is independent of the GDrive folder. You will also submit work from this repository.

4. **Link your personal github account** at [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/4O2f-hBD). This will link your personal github repository with your name on the classroom roster. We'll use this for holding assignments that you have completed so the instructors can collect them for grading; it's private to you and the instructors. 

You'll run a `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, and  `git push` to push things from your laptop/computer (where you do your work) to this private (to you and the instructors) classroom repo.

5. **Open and run a0 notebook in Colab**. Copy the `Intro_to_ML_Assignment_0.ipynb` notebook to the folder you created in GDrive. Then you double click on it to open it in Colab.  This notebook makes some simple checks and gives a taste of some of the kinds of packages we'll be working with. You don't need to write any code here - just run the cells and save.  After you have run the notebook, go to File -> Download and download an .ipynb version and overwrite the copy in you local git repository. There you can commit it to your local repo.

6. **Answer the questions in the notebook** in the `Intro_to_ML_Assignment_0.ipynb` makrdown cells. 

7. **Push your changes from the local repo to the remote repository**: In the top level (root) of your local assignment repo (on your laptop or desktop machine) run the following commands:
   `git add .`
   `git commit -m "message"`
   `git push`
  For all assignments in this course, it's your responsibility to make sure your submission has made it to your classroom GitHub repo!

Each student who correctly submits their work will receive 5 points.

**Note:**
If you choose ssh then you need to follow the directions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to generate an ssh key on your laptop and then [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to add the public key to your ssh account.

Continue on to Assignemnt 1 once it's released.  (Unlike Assignment 0, Assignment 1 isn't just a setup exercise.  Don't wait too long to get started!)
